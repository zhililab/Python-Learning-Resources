## Best Practices

Writing clean, maintainable code is essential for any developer.  Here are
some key takeaways from the Python community’s style guides and
literature:

* **Follow PEP 8** – Use 4 spaces per indentation level and limit lines
  to around 79 characters to improve readability【615368974677617†L119-L176】.  Separate
  functions and classes with blank lines and group related code
  logically【615368974677617†L119-L176】.
* **Meaningful Names** – Choose descriptive variable, function and class
  names.  Avoid single‑letter names except for short loop variables.
* **Use Docstrings** – Document modules, classes and functions using
  triple‑quoted strings so that users understand the API and internal
  behavior【156047168182090†L29-L33】.
* **Keep Functions Small** – Each function should do one thing well.  If a
  function grows too long, consider breaking it into smaller helpers.
* **Leverage Linters and Formatters** – Tools like ``flake8``, ``pylint``
  and ``black`` help ensure stylistic consistency and catch common
  mistakes【826886253017015†L146-L179】.
* **Test Your Code** – Adopt a test‑driven workflow: write tests first,
  implement the functionality and then refactor.  Automated tests
  increase confidence when refactoring and deploying changes.
* **Readability Over Cleverness** – Clear and straightforward code is
  preferred over overly clever constructs.  Remember, code is read more
  often than it is written【615368974677617†L89-L97】.

For a comprehensive reference, consult the full PEP 8 document【615368974677617†L119-L176】.
